# üí´ About Me:
I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering from Eskisehir Osmangazi University in Turkey. During my studies, I was involved in a T√úBƒ∞TAK project for one year, focused on cryptographic accumulators. My teammates and I published a paper as part of this project. Afterward, I worked as an intern at T√ºrksat, where I gained experience with the Spring Security framework and React.

I participated in the Erasmus program twice: first for a five-month academic exchange in Lithuania, and second for a volunteering internship in Italy. Currently, I am continuing my Erasmus internship as a volunteer, focusing on language diversity (Turkish-English) and contributing to the development of the Turkish WordNet.

At the same time, I am improving my skills in Java Spring Security. During my T√úBƒ∞TAK project, I worked in the areas of authentication and authorization, using OAuth2, OIDC, and Keycloak. I continue to develop projects involving Keycloak and OAuth2.

In my free time, I work on developing my own games and creating designs using Photoshop, Maya, and other tools. I was also accepted into the Google Uygulama ve Teknoloji Academy, specializing in AI-powered games.
